    * Added [`collapseMenuOnItemClick` property](http://flexberry.github.io/Documentation/master/classes/FlexberryMenu.html#property_collapseMenuOnItemClick) and related logic.
* Add `getValueFromLocales` helper function.
* Refactoring of user setting service:
    * User setting service now supports in-memory saving the settings of all `object-list-view` components for all pages. This allows:
        * Maintain user setting service on mode `APP.useUserSettingsService: false` without saving them to backend;
        * Store and appy (in future) settings for multiple components on a page;
        * Store an unlimited number of settings (default and named) for each `object-list-view` component;
        * Store (define) all the information on defaut or named setting (columns order, sorting order, columns width and other) in single object (property, backend record);
        * Customize the column widths manually by mouse or by specifying digital values;
        * Enable or disable the settings column widths;
        * Avoid repated access to the backend's usersetting service when you return to the already loaded page.
    * Support three levels of setting:
        * Defined by developer;
        * Defined by users and stored in usersetting's backend;
        * Temporary settings defined by users specified in the URL-parameters (`sort`, etc...).
        * Support user setting service for developer. After adjusting component developer can display current default and named settings and save them in [`developerUserSettings` property](http://flexberry.github.io/Documentation/master/classes/UserSettingsService.html#property_developerUserSettings)(see also [this](http://flexberry.github.io/Documentation/master/classes/IISCaseberryLoggingObjectsApplicationLogLRoute.html#property_developerUserSettings)) of `app/routes/{{pageRouteName}}.js` as default settings.

### Changed
* **Important**: now [`ember-flexberry`](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry) depends on [`ember-flexberry-data@0.3.1`](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-data/releases/tag/0.3.1) that has [api changes](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-data/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changed). So it is necessary to make corresponding changes in application source code after updating vesrion of [`ember-flexberry`](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry)!
* `flexberry-file`:
    * Removed collapsing menu logic.
    * Added [`collapseMenuOnItemClick` property](http://flexberry.github.io/Documentation/master/classes/FlexberryMenu.html#property_collapseMenuOnItemClick) to appropriate .hbs file (template).
* Blueprints:
    * `editFormRoute` property was moved to controller.

### Fixed
* Blueprints:
    * Speed up generation process.
    * Fixed adapter generation in `flexberry-core` blueprint.
* Fixed selection of value for `flexberry-lookup` component in dropdown mode.
* Fixed displaying of column settings buttons if user settings service is off or menu items list for column settings is empty.
* Fixed sorting by clicking on table header of `flexberry-objectlistview` or `flexberry-groupedit` component in Firefox.
* Fixed blueprints dependency for generation of application prototype for hide the sidebar with sitemap after click on sitemap-node.
* Fixed `flexberry-menu` for configuration of columns settings in `flexberry-objectlistview` component after changing current locale for internationalization to another language and back again.
* Now [`displayAttributeName` property](http://flexberry.github.io/Documentation/master/classes/FlexberryLookup.html#property_displayAttributeName) is required for only autocomplete and dropdown modes in `flexberry-lookup` component.

### Known issues
* Only one `flexberry-objectlistview` or `flexberry-groupedit` component could be used on particular form.
* It is not possible to open any route for generated application prototype (in case of generation of whole application prototype) because of wrong generation of internationalization mechanism. Also probably lookup components on edit forms of generated application prototype may not work.
* It is not possible to sort list of models by property of "master" model if property of another "master" model from used projection has the same name.
* No items of context menu for rows of `flexberry-objectlistview` component are shown when `showEditMenuItemInRow` or `showDeleteMenuItemInRow` property of component has been dynamically changed.
* List of values of `flexberry-dropdown` component are not showing over scroll bar when the component is embedded into `flexberry-groupedit` and there is not enough space to show these values over table rows.
* Formatted message field of log object fills differently in IE11/Safari and Chrome/Firefox.
* `flexberry-datepicker` eats too much memory, working slowly and slows down the application (especially when using multiple `flexberry-datepicker` components on form).
* "TransitionAborted" error get thrown when adding query params (callback is called once for each query param if `refreshModel: true` is set).
* `flexberry-datapicker` displays the next day when date with time is '00:00:00'.
* Placeholder text localization for `flexberry-dropdown` component works improperly when `readonly` property changes dynamically. Also placeholder text is not localize in all browsers except Google Chrome.
* Some text is not localized in user settings dialog.
* There are some problems with displaying styles of user settings dialog.
* Drop-down menu for configuration of columns settings in `flexberry-objectlistview` component stops working properly after deleting of user setting or changing page on list form.

## [0.2.1] - 2016-07-07
### Changed
* Updated information about [release process in README.md](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry/blob/master/README.md#releasing)

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2016-07-06 [YANKED]
### Added
* New components based on `object-list-view` component to work with lists of models on list forms and edit forms (see more details below):
    * `flexberry-objectlistview` - usually used on list forms to work with list of "base" models loaded in route.
    * `flexberry-groupedit` - used on edit forms to work with list of models, referenced by "base" model using hasMany relationship ("detail" models).
* Support of setting conditions ("limits") on form's routes for loading data. Limits can be set with client query language ([LINQ-like](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397926.aspx) language) defined in [ember-flexberry-data](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-data) addon.
* Support of any backend types. It is necessary to implement adapter for client query language to support a particular backend type. The adapter should translate query object into request specific to corresponding backend. There are several adapters implemented in [ember-flexberry-data](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-data) addon:
    * Adapter for [OData-based](http://www.odata.org/) backends.

* Renamed `drop-down` component to `flexberry-dropdown`.
* Renamed `lookup-field` component to `flexberry-lookup`.
* Base adapter and serializer for communication with backend via [OData protocol](http://www.odata.org/) was moved to [ember-flexberry-data](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-data) addon (this addon was formerly named as `ember-flexberry-projections`). So now [`ember-flexberry`](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry) depends on [`ember-flexberry-data@0.2.0`](https://github.com/Flexberry/ember-flexberry-data/releases/tag/0.2.0)
* Redesigned enumerations support.

### Deprecated
* `ui-message` component:
    * `title` property is deprecated, use `caption` property instead.

### Removed
* Authenticator, authorizer, login route and controller for support of token based authentication were removed. Authentication is not supported for now.

### Fixed
* Fixed saving model logic on edit forms so that corresponding OData-queries is now making following the [standard](http://www.odata.org/documentation/).
* Fixed setting of date in binded model property when typing date manually using `flexberry-datepicker` component.
* Fixed support of embedding components in table cell of `object-list-view` component to display and edit specific field of the model.

### Known issues
* Only one `flexberry-objectlistview` or `flexberry-groupedit` component could be used on particular form.
* Internationalization is not implemented for captions in model projections.
* It is not possible to open any route for generated application prototype (in case of generation of whole application prototype) because of wrong generation of internationalization mechanism.
* It is not possible to sort list of models by property of "master" model if property of another "master" model from used projection has the same name.
* Some items of context menu for rows of `flexberry-objectlistview` component are disappearnig when `showEditMenuItemInRow` or `showDeleteMenuItemInRow` property of component has been dynamically changed.
* Sorting by clicking on table header of `flexberry-objectlistview` or `flexberry-groupedit` component is not working in Firefox.
* List of values of `flexberry-dropdown` component are not showing over scroll bar when the component is embedded into `flexberry-groupedit` and there is not enough space to show these values over table rows.
* Logs for rejected promises are not saving on backend.
* Formatted message field of log object fills differently in IE11/Safari and Chrome/Firefox.
* `flexberry-datepicker` eats too much memory, working slowly and slows down the application (especially when using multiple `flexberry-datepicker` components on form).
* Drop-down menu for configuration of columns settings in `flexberry-objectlistview` component stops working after changing current locale for internationalization to another language and back again.
* Drop-down menu for configuration of columns settings in `flexberry-objectlistview` component stops working properly after saving user setting on backend.
* Saving user settings for `flexberry-groupedit` component and for `flexberry-objectlistview` that shows for choosing value for `flexberry-lookup` component doesn't work correctly. It is possible to use `notUseUserSettings` property for `flexberry-objectlistview` component to turn off user settings for these cases as workaround.
